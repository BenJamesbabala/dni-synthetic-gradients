= Torch implementation of Decoupled Neural Interfaces

Here I reproduce some of the MNIST experiments from DeepMind's paper, [Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05343).

My starting point was the MNIST torch demo, [train a digit classifer](https://github.com/torch/demos/tree/master/train-a-digit-classifier).
